# Driver-Behavior-Learning
Data from Video Logging Tool (VLT) is used to predict the distance the driver maintains between the subject vehicle and a target vehicle using a vanilla LSTM model.
Features such as Average speed, Inverse Time to collision(TTC), longitudinal and polar distances from the preceding vehicle are used for the regression problem
that predicts TTC.

For more details on the results please read the report in the repo.
